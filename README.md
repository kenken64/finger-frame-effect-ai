# Finger Frame AI 🎬✨

**Try it: https://sophiamyang.github.io/finger-frame-effect-ai/**

Upload a video of the two-hand finger-frame gesture — get it back with an
**AI-generated world inside the frame**. The whole video is restyled by a
video-to-video model (motion, blinks, and all), then composited so the
finger frame acts as a window into the animated version.

## The finger-frame family

| App | Generation | Latency |
|---|---|---|
| [finger-frame-effect](https://sophiamyang.github.io/finger-frame-effect/) ([repo](https://github.com/sophiamyang/finger-frame-effect)) — live camera, local effects | Canvas 2D (Van Gogh, toon, glitch, …) | none |
| **this app** — recorded video, AI restyle | FLUX Video Edit through OpenRouter (offline video edit) | minutes |
| [finger-frame-effect-lucy](https://sophiamyang.github.io/finger-frame-effect-lucy/) ([repo](https://github.com/sophiamyang/finger-frame-effect-lucy)) — live camera, live AI | Decart Lucy 2.5 (realtime video-to-video) | ~real time |

*Real hands, AI world — generated with the default "3D animated movie"
style ([full-quality mp4](examples/final.mp4)).*

## How it works

1. **Restyle** — the uploaded video is sent to
   [FLUX Video Edit through OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/black-forest-labs/flux-video-edit)
   with your chosen style (3D animated movie, anime, claymation,
   watercolor, or a custom prompt). This is a true video model: the whole
   clip is regenerated, so the animated version moves exactly like you.
   Every prompt gets a strict-alignment suffix appended — same framing, no
   zoom/crop/recentering, facial features at the same screen coordinates,
   expression preserved frame by frame (mouth openness, blinks, gaze) — so
   the result lines up behind the finger-frame window.
2. **Track** — MediaPipe Hand Landmarker finds both hands per frame, and the
   finger-frame quad is tracked with the same audited pipeline as the live
   app (anatomical corner ordering — crossing your fingers renders the
   bowtie — spread/area gates with hysteresis, teleport rejection,
   velocity-adaptive smoothing, dropout hold, presence fade).
3. **Composite** — the AI video is revealed through the tracked quad with
   the dashed marching-ants outline and pulsing corner dots.
4. **Export** — the result records to a downloadable video — MP4 where the
   browser supports recording it (Safari, newer Chrome), otherwise `.webm`
   (convert with `ffmpeg -i finger-frame-ai.webm -c:v libx264 out.mp4`).

## Bring your own key

The AI step uses your own [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys),
entered in the app. It stays in your browser (localStorage only if you check
"remember") and is sent only to OpenRouter. Generation uses FLUX Video Edit
(Black Forest Labs), is billed per output second (3¢/s), and takes a few
minutes. Use a 4–15 second
clip in any common format (mp4, mov, webm). Clips over 15MB are downscaled and
compressed to 480p in the browser before upload. OpenRouter requires an HTTPS
video URL, so the processed input is temporarily uploaded to `uguu.se`
and that URL is sent to OpenRouter. No key? The **placeholder style** button runs the full
track-composite-export pipeline with a hue-shifted stand-in so you can try
everything for free.

## Run locally

Run the included local server. It proxies temporary video uploads and
OpenRouter requests so browser cross-origin restrictions do not interrupt jobs:

```bash
python server.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8124. A `?src=<file>` query param loads a video
from the server directory (dev convenience).

## CLI alternative (Python)

The same pipeline as offline scripts — useful for batch work or
frame-accurate H.264 output:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
.venv/bin/python stylize.py input.mp4 -o stylized.mp4      # AI restyle
.venv/bin/python composite.py input.mp4 stylized.mp4 -o final.mp4
```

Any input format ffmpeg/OpenCV can read works (mp4, mov, webm, …).
`composite.py` needs `ffmpeg` on PATH, outputs H.264 MP4, and carries over
the original audio track when present.

## Notes

- Input/output media are gitignored — personal footage stays local. The
  only committed media is the sample under `examples/`.
